# Machine Learning Summary

This document aims to summerize the basic knowledge to get into the general study of Machine learning and its application.

## ML Frameworks

There are several machine learning frameworks available, each with its own strengths, weaknesses, and areas of application. Here are some of the most popular ones:

* `TensorFlow`: Developed by Google Brain, TensorFlow is one of the most widely used machine learning frameworks. It provides a comprehensive ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community support. TensorFlow supports both deep learning and traditional machine learning algorithms and offers high-level APIs like Keras for easier model building.

* `PyTorch`: Developed by Facebook's AI Research lab, PyTorch is known for its dynamic computation graph, which makes it easier to work with compared to TensorFlow's static graph. It's particularly popular among researchers due to its flexibility and ease of debugging.

* `Keras`: Although Keras can be used as a standalone library, it's often used as a high-level API on top of TensorFlow. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for building neural networks, making it a great choice for beginners and rapid prototyping.

* `Scikit-learn`: Scikit-learn is a popular machine learning library in Python. It provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis, including various algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and more.

* `MXNet`: Developed by Apache, MXNet is known for its scalability and efficiency, particularly in distributed computing environments. It offers both high-level APIs for quick model development and low-level APIs for fine-tuning and optimization.

* `Caffe`: Caffe is a deep learning framework developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center. It's known for its speed and efficiency, particularly in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). While it's less flexible than some other frameworks, it's well-suited for tasks like image classification and object detection.

* `Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK)`: Developed by Microsoft, CNTK is a deep learning framework known for its scalability and support for distributed training. It provides both high-level APIs for easy model development and low-level APIs for performance optimization.

* `Theano`: While not as actively developed as some other frameworks, Theano was one of the first deep learning libraries and has contributed to the development of subsequent frameworks. It's known for its efficiency in symbolic mathematical computations.

These are just a few examples, and there are many other machine learning frameworks and libraries available, each with its own strengths and use cases. The choice of framework often depends on factors such as the specific requirements of the project, the familiarity of the user with the framework, and community support.
